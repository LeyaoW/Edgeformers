I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.

Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent.", "summary": "Excellent product and showed me that my vent obviously needed a cleaning", "unixReviewTime": 1458432000}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.\n\nNow our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

I was a bit skeptical about spending so much money on a range hood, but this thing is a game-changer. The installation was a breeze, and the features are so easy to use. The built-in WiFi connectivity allows me to control the hood from my phone, which is amazing for when I'm cooking and need to adjust the fan speed or turn it off. The sensors are super accurate, and the exhaust fan is so quiet that I can barely hear it running. The design is sleek and modern, and it looks great with my new kitchen cabinets. The customer service was also top-notch - when I had a question, I got a prompt response from the manufacturer's support team.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

The installation process was relatively easy, and the hood looks sleek and modern in my kitchen. The WiFi connectivity is also seamless, allowing me to control it through the app and receive notifications when it's in use.  However, the performance of the hood has been somewhat underwhelming. The filters can get clogged easily, and the suction power is not as strong as I expected. The hood also tends to make a strange humming noise when it's in operation, which can be annoying at times.  Overall, I would give this product 3 out of 5 stars. While it's a nice addition to my kitchen, it falls short in terms of performance and durability. If you're in the market for a WiFi range hood, I would recommend exploring other options.  ", "summary": "Does what it needs to", "unixReviewTime": 1473465600}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

I've been using it daily for the past month and it's been a game-changer for my baking.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that the mixer can be a bit loud when running at high speeds, but this is a minor complaint and not a deal-breaker. Overall, I highly recommend this mixer to anyone in the market for a reliable and powerful stand mixer.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out.

The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

The machine can be a bit finicky, and I've experienced issues with it not turning on or not dispensing coffee when I need it.  One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of features. It doesn't have a built-in grinder, so I have to grind my own beans, which can be a hassle. Additionally, the machine doesn't have a timer or scheduling feature, which would be nice for making a pot of coffee at a specific time.  Overall, I would recommend this coffee maker to someone who is looking for a basic, no-frills machine.

I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The slow cooker's ability to cook food evenly is decent, but it can be a bit slow, especially when cooking larger quantities. The digital interface is user-friendly, but the touchscreen can be finicky at times, and the temperature control can be a bit finicky.  The real letdown is the durability of the unit. After only a few months of moderate use, I noticed that the exterior started to show signs of wear and tear, with a slight rust spot on the lid and some scratches on the exterior. The non-stick coating on the cooking surface also started to chip after only a few uses.  Overall, I would recommend this slow cooker to those who are looking for a basic, no-frills cooking solution. However, if you're looking for a high-quality, long-lasting unit, I would suggest considering other options.  Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

This is the same reason why we ask for a copy of your receipt upon requesting warranty claims because if it not from a valid authorized dealer we will not proceed with warranty work. We also list our authorized dealers on our web site for customer use. We stand behind our products, however when an item is purchased from a private seller the purchaser runs the risk of the item being used, open box, refurbished, and or a scratch and dent. Our one year limited manufacturer's warranty is only valid on new items sold by our authorized online dealers.

Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who \"authorized dealers\" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?\n\nI sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.\n\nPlease let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.

One of the things I love most about this mixer is its durability. The stainless steel bowl and metal gears are built to last, and I've had it for over a year now without any issues. The mixer is also very easy to clean, with a simple and intuitive design that makes it a breeze to wipe down and store.  Overall, I would highly recommend the KitchenAid KCM0403OB to anyone in the market for a reliable and versatile stand mixer. It's a worthwhile investment that will pay for itself in the long", "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1439424000}

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

The design and build quality are decent, and it fits perfectly in my kitchen. However, there are some issues that have led to a 3-star rating.  The fridge is quiet and keeps my food at the right temperature, but the ice maker is a bit finicky. It often doesn't produce ice cubes as frequently as I'd like, and when it does, they're sometimes too small. The freezer section is also a bit cramped, which makes it difficult to store larger items.  Another issue I've noticed is that the door seals are a bit loose, which allows cold air to escape and makes the fridge work harder to maintain the temperature. I've tried tightening the seals, but it doesn't seem to make a significant difference.  Despite these issues, I've had no major problems with the fridge's performance or energy efficiency.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.

The installation was relatively straightforward, and the app-controlled features are convenient, allowing me to turn the hood on and off remotely.  However, I've encountered some issues with the fan's performance. While it's quiet when running, it doesn't seem to be as effective at removing grease and odors as I had hoped. The filter cleaning process can be a bit of a pain, and I've had to clean it out more frequently than I'd like. Additionally, the hood's connectivity issues have caused it to sometimes lose its WiFi signal, requiring me to restart it multiple times.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

The spacious interior with adjustable shelves and crisper drawers is perfect for storing large items like turkeys and large vegetables. The ice maker and water dispenser are also super convenient and easy to use. The temperature control is precise and the humidity control is spot on, keeping my fruits and veggies fresh for days. The noise level is also surprisingly quiet, even when it's running. I've had it for a few weeks now and I've had zero issues with it. The delivery and installation process was also seamless and the customer service was top-notch.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

My only minor complaint is that the mixer can be a bit heavy, but overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in. It worked!

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.\n\nI was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

The fridge has also been keeping my food at the perfect temperature, and the humidity control feature has been a game-changer for keeping my fruits and veggies fresh for longer.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.\n\nI was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

However, I've noticed that the temperature control can be a bit finicky at times, and I've had to adjust it multiple times to get it to the desired setting. Additionally, the ice maker has been making a weird noise that's been annoying, but it's not a deal-breaker.  The exterior design is sleek and modern, and it looks great in my kitchen. The LED lights inside are also a nice touch. However, the door seals could be better, and I've noticed that it's not as quiet as I expected.  Overall, I would recommend this refrigerator to someone who's looking for a basic, no-frills appliance. It gets the job done, but it's not the best I've ever owned.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can.

This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.\n\nNow our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

However, I've had some issues with the performance of the cooker. It takes a while to heat up, and the temperature control can be a bit finicky.

The stainless steel bowl is durable and easy to clean, and the various attachments that come with it have been a game-changer for me. The mixer is also very quiet and has a smooth, consistent beat, making it perfect for whipping up large batches of frosting or kneading dough.  The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that the mixer can be a bit tricky to assemble and the manual could be more detailed. However, overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a reliable and versatile stand mixer.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly.

The preset settings are limited, and I had to adjust the cooking time manually to get the results I wanted. Additionally, the temperature control is not as precise as I expected, which made it difficult to achieve the perfect temperature for certain types of dishes.  On the plus side, the slow cooker is easy to clean and the ceramic insert is dishwasher safe. The lid is also quite large, which makes it easy to add and remove ingredients without having to juggle multiple dishes.  Overall, I would give this slow cooker 3 out of 5 stars.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.

If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

Additionally, the non-stick coating on the pot is not as non-stick as I had hoped, and some of the food still sticks to the sides and bottom.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.\n\nI was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.\n\nI was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking!

Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).

Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I've also been impressed with the energy efficiency and noise level - it's surprisingly quiet and doesn't waste any energy.

The cooking time is also relatively quick, taking only about 6-8 hours to cook a large pot of chili.  However, the cooking results have been inconsistent, and I've had to adjust the cooking time multiple times to get the desired consistency. The temperature control is also a bit finicky, and I've had to adjust the setting multiple times to get the right temperature. Additionally, the lid can be a bit tricky to remove, and I've had to use a bit of force to get it off.  Overall, I would recommend this slow cooker to someone who is looking for a basic, no-frills option, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a high-end slow cooker with precise temperature control.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in.

Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.

I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.", "summary": "Does what it needs to", "unixReviewTime": 1473465600}

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!\nThe part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.

Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The good: it cooks food quickly, which is exactly what I was looking for. I made a delicious chicken stew in under 30 minutes, which was a huge time-saver. The pressure cooker also seems to be well-made and has a nice, sturdy build.  However, there are some drawbacks. The lid doesn't fit perfectly, and I've had to force it shut a few times. The non-stick coating on the pot is also starting to wear off after a few uses. Additionally, the manual that comes with the product is very thin and doesn't provide much in the way of troubleshooting or maintenance instructions.  Overall, I'd say this pressure cooker is a decent option for someone who is new to pressure cooking, but it may not be the best choice for someone who is looking for a high-end model with more features and better build quality.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.", "summary": "Works Great, Just Use Common Sense When Doing It!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515974400}

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!", "summary": "A great device that has my dryer working well again. Simple instructions here.", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

However, I've noticed that the fridge has a tendency to run hot, especially on the top shelf. I've checked the temperature settings, and it seems to be set correctly, but the temperature inside the fridge can still get up to 40 degrees Fahrenheit on the top shelf. This is not a huge issue, but it's something to be aware of.  The door seals are also a bit flimsy, and I've noticed that they don't seal properly when I close the door. This can lead to a bit of a draft, which can make the fridge work harder and increase the energy bill.  Overall, I would say that this fridge is an average product. It gets the job done, but it's not the best I've ever owned.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another.

The oven also tends to heat unevenly, which can be frustrating when trying to cook delicate foods.  Additionally, the cleaning process can be a bit of a hassle. The crumb tray is small and can get clogged easily, and the exterior can get dirty and dusty. The oven also tends to produce a strong smell when cooking certain types of food, which can linger for a while.  Overall, I would give this toaster oven 3 out of 5 stars.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.", "summary": "Excellent choice for cleaning out dryer vent line. Worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1478649600}

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps.

The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly.

I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.

We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!\n\nHelpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line.

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.

The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.\n\nSo enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.\n\n1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.\n2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.\n3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.\n4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).\n5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.\n6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it.

This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?\n\nIt will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.\n\nThat said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.\n\nNow our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!", "summary": "5 stars isn't enough to rate this product!

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.", "summary": "This really worked well even taking shortcuts", "unixReviewTime": 1449273600}
